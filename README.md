## About the Game

Super Hexagon is an intense, minimalist arcade game where you control a small triangle navigating through a rotating hexagonal maze. The objective is simple: survive as long as possible while walls close in from all directions. The game features:

- **Rotating perspective** that adds to the challenge and disorientation
- **Progressively increasing difficulty** with faster rotation and wall speeds
- **Score tracking** with local storage for personal best records
- **Smooth, responsive controls** using keyboard input
- **Minimalist visual design** with clean geometric shapes
